## DevOps

----

### Actors : Devs
> Anyone working in the development of an application to its release.

Ops want stability to keep a high satisfaction level from client.

----

### Definition

### So, what is DevOps

* It is **a cross-team mindset** like agility
* You must ask yourself **how to get a better deliverable from input team** (ex: product manager)
* And **how to produce a better deliverable for output team** (ex: Ops team)
* Always think **automation** and **continous improvement**
* **Develop to the target** (Dev == Staging == Prod)

----

### Wins

* Raise **product reliability**
* **Shorten Time To Market** (TTM)
* **Keep your teams**

----

### How to start

* Not an easy task as **we cannot force mindset**
* DevOps practices **can be initiated from teams**
* **Start simple**, then implement new practices:
  * Master **Agile and technical tools**
  * **Continuous Integration** / **Continuous Delivery**
  * **Continuous Deployment**
  * **Continuous Operations**
